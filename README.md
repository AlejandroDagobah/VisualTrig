## About
VisualTrig is a Trigonometry visualization tool to understand through real-time visualization how the different trigonometry reasons work, it allows you to:

* Visualize in the unit circle how all the trigonometry reasons work in each degree.
* Visualize in a cartasian plane where **x** is the radians of the circle how each trigonometry reason is represented.
* Visualize the current size of each reason in the cartasian plane with a cursor that travels trough the curve of each trigonometry reason.
* Change the degrees of (x).
* Change the Radius size (in pixels).
* Get the current value of each trigonometry reason in each degree.
* Turn On/Off all the trigonometry reasons and their Cursors.
